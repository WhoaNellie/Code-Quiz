# Code-Quiz

## Description

This is my fourth project for UA's coding bootcamp. It is Javascript Code Quiz using only vanilla Javascript. 

## Installation

To install this project all you need to do is download the repository and open index.html using your browser of choice. Alternatively, you could just go to the github page for this website.

## Usage

To use this project, select the "Start Quiz" button. Read the questions and select which one you think is correct before the time limit. Incorrect answers result in a slight penalty, letting time elapse will just bring you to the next question.

After taking the quiz you may enter your name and submit your results to the scoreboard. It will show the top 10 local results sorted by their scores.
